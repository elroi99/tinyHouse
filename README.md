# Description
Tiny House is a typical Vacation Rental Site. Think AirBNB. I starting building this site in order to test my UI skills and in order to cement the lessons that I learnt while building my previous portfolio project [Atlas-Clone](https://github.com/elroi99/atlas-clone)
Tiny House has been built using HTML , CSS , React Js FrontEnd framework , MUI ( Material UI ) component library on the front end and The Firebase backend as a service on the back end. Stripe was used to power the payments.
When I started building TinyHouse, I was familiar with most of the above technologies, as a result, there was less of a learning curve and I could concentrate on writing cleaner code. 

While building TinyHouse, my main objective was to test my UI skills, and thus, I have attempted to create as close a copy to the original app as possible. For the most part, I have succeeded at this task.
