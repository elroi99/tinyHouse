# Description
Tiny House is a typical Vacation Rental Site. Think AirBNB. I starting building this site in order to test my UI skills and in order to cement the lessons that I learnt while building my previous portfolio project [Atlas-Clone](https://github.com/elroi99/atlas-clone)
Tiny House has been built using HTML , CSS , React Js FrontEnd framework , MUI ( Material UI ) component library on the front end and The Firebase backend as a service on the back end. Stripe was used to power the payments.
When I started building TinyHouse, I was familiar with most of the above technologies, as a result, there was less of a learning curve and I could concentrate on writing cleaner code. 

While building TinyHouse, my main objective was to test my UI skills, and thus, I have attempted to create as close a copy to the original app as possible. For the most part, I have succeeded at this task.

<!-- 
The process for installing and running tinyHouse on the local machine is more complicated because we use netlify functions in this project
it involves forking the project to your own repo , connecting netlify cli to that repo  , and then starting the development server ( react + netlify fn's) 
using netlify cli instead of npm start. -- I am not sure of the complete instruction set.

# Running the code on your local machine

## Dependencies
- Node.JS -- Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. 
- NPM ( Node Package Manager ) -- We will be using Node.js and NPM to run the project.
- Netlify CLI ( Needed to run the Netlify Serverless Functions locally ) 

## Installation Instructions
### Part 1 ( Install Netlify CLI globally using NPM )
1. Install Netlify CLI globally on your local machine
	`npm install netlify-cli -g`



### Part 2 ( Install and run TinyHouse )
1. Get a copy of the project on your local machine by running the following command
	 `git clone https://github.com/elroi99/tinyHouse.git`
 2. Enter the project directory 
	 `cd tinyHouse`
 3. install dependencies using npm
	 `npm install`
 4. Run the project 
	 `npm start`
	 
Give it some time ...... Breathe in .. Breathe out.  
Node should start a development server on your local machine.  
You should be able to view TinyHouse in your browser at localhost://3000 ( unless you opened it on another port )

#### Thats it ðŸ¥³ ðŸ¥³ !! -->
